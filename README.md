# bank-account-and-savings-account-for-class-inheritance
This is a Python solution for a technical question I was asked during 
an interview with a FinTech company. The aim was to show how 
class inheritance works in Python using concepts from 
banking accounts and saving accounts. 

Here I define two classes:
- BankingAccount: a class that has the protected attributes
    - Account Number
    - Account Holder Name
    - Account Balance
   and allows for deposit and withdrawal operations on the account balance.
- Savings Account: a class that inherits the Banking Account class 
   and allows for interest to be applied to the account balance.
   
I also provide testing of the code, through printed outputs.
